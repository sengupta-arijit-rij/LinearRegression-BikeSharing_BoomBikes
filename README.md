## General Information
#
## BoomBike: BoomBike a bike sharing business wants to analyze the 2 years data they have to create a business strategy for their upcoming year based on the inferences and various  external/Internal parameters that affect the demand for their Bike rides
#
#
## On Analysing the Dataset we see that the Target Variable is a continuous numerical variable representing the demand of bikes.
## Base on the above we are progressing with Linear Regression Modelling to predict the independent variables that might have an effect on their bike demand
#
## The Dataset shared has data for 2 years with no null values and parameters like Day of the week, holidays, Weather Situations, Seasons. We will analyse all the Variables  using univariate, bivariate as well as multivariate analysis to infer as much insights possible 
## We will then proceed and start creating best fit models for the Training dataset varying the Independent variables as necessary.
#
## Finally we will pridict the Test Data set based on the Linear regression Model that we finalize using the Train Dataset

#
## Conclusions
- We see a positive correlation between temperature and the demand
- We also see that Seasons are correlated with demand
- Weather Situations also show correlation with Demand
- Day of the week have some correlations with Demand
- A Linear Regression model is built with 81% Accuracy
- The model created predicted the Test data accurately
